# Telco-Customer-Churn
The telecommunications company is experiencing a high rate of customer churn, which adversely impacts its revenue and market share. The company lacks a systematic approach to identify and predict customers who are likely to churn, making it difficult to take proactive measures to retain them

# Goal: 
Develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning by analyzing historical data and uncovering patterns that indicate potential churn. The model should provide actionable insights that the company can use to implement effective retention strategies and reduce churn rates.
# Objectives:
1.	Analyze historical customer data to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn.
2.	Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn.
3.	Provide actionable insights and recommendations to reduce churn rates.
# Data Source: 
The Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on 7,043 customers, including features like tenure, monthly charges, contract type, payment method, and whether the customer churned or not.
# Expected Outcomes:
•	A predictive model capable of identifying at-risk customers.
•	Actionable insights to inform retention strategies.
•	Visualizations and dashboards for real-time monitoring of customer churn.
